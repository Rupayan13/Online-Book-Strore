# Online-Book-Strore
This is a online bookstrore where you can buy a book of mentioned categories and after payment you will receive the soft copy of the book through you email.Here we used the stripe api for payment gateway and we used php and mysql database for making its backend, and its frontend totally depends on html and css. Here I attached some picture of my online bookstore. We also have a admin panel to manage all the clients and users.
